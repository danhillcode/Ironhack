5:18 PM Some (maybe) helpful links for you final projects:- display locations on ​Google Maps​ README:
 https://github.com/mediafinger/Locations
 (please :star: this repo, if you like it)- implement ​pagination​ on your pages
 https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari
 (easy to use flexible gem with a good README)- ​file uploads, image resizing​, clipping, converting
 https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave
 (You will need the ImageMagick or MiniMagick library)- Client-side ​Form Validations​ to avoid server response time
 https://github.com/DavyJonesLocker/client_side_validations
 (direct feedback to users while filling out a form)But don't go too wild with gems and extra feature - remember to focus on the core of your idea and leave everything else for later (when you have time left over).
