#Use sort to order the homes by their price. Lowest to highest should be the default. 
#Instead of having your program end its execution after showing the homes, have it wait for user input. 
#Give the user the option to sort by price but with highest first. Also give the user the option to sort by capacity.
#Use different calls to the sort method to do all of these.
